      <h4>Backstory</h4>
      <p>Hi, I am Clare. I was born and raised in Denver, where I have two younger brothers, Brendan and Alex.  True to my Colorado roots, I am a huge Broncos fan, although I do have a soft spot for the Seattle Sounders. I moved to Seattle for college at Seattle University where I ran track and majored in Biological Engineering. Following college, I worked as a molecular biologist in Denver specializing in yeast genome engineering to generate fermentable pathways... basically, brewing jet fuel! </p>

      <h4>Currently</h4>
      <p>Since moving back to Seattle, I began working as a genetic egineer for a biochemical company. Outside of work, I love getting outside to hike and ski with my two dogs, Dexter and Tucker, or staying in the city to eat sushi and try local breweries with my boyfriend, Tony. All four of us are looking forward to going paddleboarding this summer.</p>

      <h4>Coding Ambitions</h4>
      <p>I am hoping you will see my gifted and talented html, css, and javascripting ability and consider me for the August 31 DA for Front End Web Development!</p>
